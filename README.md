# Hydra Language

Syntax highlighting for the Hydra Language

Check out the language here:
[Hydra Language](https://github.com/alan-d-mitchell/Hydra)

## Features

Quite literally just an extension for me alone to get syntax highlighting because plaintext is bad when trying to test a language

**Enjoy!**
